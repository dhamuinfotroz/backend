**GS PAPER --I HISTORY**

**1.Ancient History**

**Prehistoric Times**

Prehistoric times refer to the period before the invention of writing
and are studied through archaeological evidence. In India, prehistoric
culture is divided into the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic
periods. The Paleolithic Age is characterized by the use of crude stone
tools and a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, with important sites such as
Bhimbetka, Hunsgi, and Narmada Valley. The Mesolithic Age shows the use
of microliths, beginning of domestication of animals, and rock
paintings, especially at Bhimbetka. The Neolithic Age marks the
beginning of agriculture, permanent settlements, pottery, and polished
stone tools, with sites like Mehrgarh, Burzahom, and Chirand. These
stages indicate the gradual cultural and technological development of
early humans in the Indian subcontinent.

**Indus Valley Civilization**

The Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization,
was one of the earliest urban civilizations of the world. It flourished
around 2600--1900 BCE in the north-western parts of the Indian
subcontinent. Major sites include Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, Dholavira,
Lothal, Kalibangan, Banawali, and Rakhigarhi. The civilization is known
for its advanced town planning based on a grid pattern. Cities had
well-planned streets, standardized baked-brick houses, and efficient
drainage systems. A citadel and a lower town were common features. The
Great Bath of Mohenjo-daro indicates ritualistic practices. Granaries
suggest organized storage of surplus grain. The economy was based on
agriculture, trade, and craftsmanship. Crops such as wheat, barley, and
cotton were cultivated. Trade links existed with Mesopotamia, known as
Meluha. The people used standardized weights and measures. Harappan
seals made of steatite show animal figures and an undeciphered script.
Bronze tools and terracotta figurines were common. Religious practices
included worship of a mother goddess and a proto-Shiva figure. The
civilization declined around 1900 BCE, possibly due to environmental and
climatic factors.

**Rig Vedic Period**

The Rig Vedic Period represents the earliest phase of Vedic civilization
in India. It is generally dated between 1500 BCE and 1000 BCE. The main
source of information for this period is the *Rig Veda*. The society was
primarily pastoral in nature, with cattle being the main measure of
wealth. People lived in small tribal settlements called *grama*. The
basic political unit was the jana, led by a chief known as the rajan.
Important assemblies included the sabha and samiti. The family was
patriarchal, but women enjoyed a respectable position in society. Varna
system existed in a simple and flexible form. The economy was based on
cattle rearing and limited agriculture. Barter system was prevalent.
Religious life centered on the worship of natural forces such as Indra,
Agni, Varuna, and Soma. Rituals and sacrifices were performed by
priests. There were no temples or idol worship. The society was largely
egalitarian and simple in nature.

**Later Vedic Period**

The Later Vedic Period marks the second phase of Vedic civilization. It
is generally dated from 1000 BCE to 600 BCE. The main sources of
information are the Samaveda, Yajurveda, Atharvaveda, Brahmanas,
Aranyakas, and Upanishads. Society became more settled and agrarian in
nature. Iron tools led to the expansion of agriculture and clearing of
forests. Large kingdoms known as janapadas emerged in place of tribal
units. The power of the king increased and hereditary monarchy became
common. The varna system became rigid and birth-based. Brahmins and
Kshatriyas gained higher status, while Shudras occupied a lower
position. Position of women declined, and practices like child marriage
appeared. The economy expanded with agriculture, crafts, and trade.
Religious practices became complex with elaborate sacrifices and
rituals. Importance of Brahmins increased in society. Philosophical
ideas developed in the Upanishads, focusing on karma, Brahman, and
moksha. This period laid the foundation for later religious reform
movements like Buddhism and Jainism.

**Jainism**

Jainism is one of the oldest religious traditions of India. It was
systematized in the 6th century BCE by Vardhamana Mahavira, the 24th
Tirthankara. Jainism believes in a long line of Tirthankaras, with
Rishabhanatha considered the first. The main philosophy of Jainism is
based on the Tri-ratna or Three Jewels---right faith, right knowledge,
and right conduct. The core principle is ahimsa or non-violence, which
is practiced in its strictest form. Jainism also emphasizes aparigraha
(non-possession) and anekantavada (multiplicity of viewpoints). It
rejects the authority of the Vedas and the concept of a creator god.
Salvation is achieved through self-discipline and asceticism. Jain monks
follow severe austerities and renounce worldly life. Jainism is divided
into two main sects---Digambara and Shvetambara. Important Jain texts
are called Agamas and are written mainly in Prakrit. Jainism contributed
to Indian art and architecture, especially cave temples and sculptures.
It also promoted ethical values like tolerance, truth, and non-violence
in Indian society.

**Buddhism**

Buddhism originated in India in the 6th century BCE. It was founded by
Gautama Buddha, also known as Siddhartha Gautama. Buddhism rejects the
authority of the Vedas and the practice of elaborate rituals. The
central teachings of Buddhism are the Four Noble Truths, which explain
the nature of suffering and its cessation. The Eightfold Path provides
the way to attain Nirvana. Buddhism emphasizes the Middle Path, avoiding
extreme indulgence and severe austerity. It believes in karma, rebirth,
and impermanence (anicca). The doctrine of anatman rejects the idea of a
permanent soul. Buddhist teachings were spread in Pali language.
Important Buddhist texts are the Tripitakas---Vinaya, Sutta, and
Abhidhamma Pitakas. Buddhism was supported by rulers like Ashoka,
Kanishka, and Harsha. It spread to Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, Central
Asia, and East Asia. Major Buddhist sects include Theravada, Mahayana,
and Vajrayana. Buddhism contributed significantly to Indian art,
architecture, and ethics.

**Mahajanapadas Period**

The Mahajanapadas period marks an important stage in ancient Indian
history. It is generally dated between 600 BCE and 300 BCE. During this
period, large territorial states known as Mahajanapadas emerged. There
were sixteen Mahajanapadas mentioned in Buddhist texts like the
Anguttara Nikaya. These states developed from earlier tribal janapadas.
Some Mahajanapadas were monarchies, while others were republican in
nature, known as gana-sanghas. Important Mahajanapadas included Magadha,
Kosala, Vatsa, Avanti, Kuru, Panchala, and Vajji. Magadha emerged as the
most powerful state. Its rise was due to fertile land, iron resources,
and strong rulers. Capitals like Rajagriha and Pataliputra became major
political centers. The use of iron tools increased agricultural
production. Trade and urbanization expanded during this period. Coins
known as punch-marked coins came into use. Buddhism and Jainism gained
prominence and royal patronage. This period laid the foundation for the
Mauryan Empire.

**Mauryan Empire**

The Mauryan Empire was the first large empire in ancient India. It was
founded by Chandragupta Maurya around 321 BCE with the help of Chanakya.
The empire extended from Afghanistan to Karnataka and from Assam to
western India. Chandragupta Maurya overthrew the Nanda dynasty and
established a strong centralized administration. Megasthenes, the Greek
ambassador, described Mauryan administration in his work *Indica*.
Bindusara, his successor, expanded the empire further. Ashoka the Great
was the most famous Mauryan ruler. After the Kalinga War, Ashoka adopted
Buddhism and followed the policy of *Dhamma*. He promoted moral values
like non-violence, tolerance, and compassion. Ashoka issued edicts
inscribed on rocks and pillars across the empire. The Mauryan
administration was highly organized with efficient bureaucracy.
Agriculture was the main source of revenue. Trade and commerce
flourished under state control. The empire declined after Ashoka due to
weak successors and administrative difficulties.

**Post-Mauryan India**

After the decline of the Mauryan Empire around 185 BCE, India witnessed
the rise of regional kingdoms and foreign invasions. The Shunga dynasty
(c. 185--73 BCE) succeeded the Mauryas in Magadha and promoted
Brahmanical culture while resisting foreign invasions. The Kanva dynasty
briefly replaced the Shungas. In the northwest, Indo-Greek,
Indo-Scythian, and Indo-Parthian kingdoms established control and
contributed to art and trade. The Satavahanas (c. 1st century BCE--3rd
century CE) ruled the Deccan, promoting trade, agriculture, and Buddhist
culture. The Kushanas, under rulers like Kanishka, expanded northwestern
India and supported Mahayana Buddhism. They facilitated trade along the
Silk Route and contributed to art, including Gandhara and Mathura
sculptures. Regional powers like the Nagas, Vakatakas, and Kadambas also
emerged. This period saw the growth of urban centers, guilds, and
long-distance trade. Religious diversity increased with Buddhism,
Jainism, and Brahmanism coexisting. Sanskrit and Prakrit literature
flourished. Art, architecture, and coinage reflected regional
influences. The Post-Mauryan period laid the foundation for Gupta rule,
often called the "Golden Age" of India.

**Gupta Period**

The Gupta period (c. 320--550 CE) is known as the "Golden Age" of India
due to significant achievements in politics, culture, and economy. The
dynasty was founded by Sri Gupta, but Chandragupta I established its
prominence. Samudragupta and Chandragupta II expanded the empire through
conquests and diplomacy. The administration was centralized with
provincial governors overseeing regions. The period saw stability,
prosperity, and flourishing trade, both inland and overseas. Hinduism
gained prominence, but Buddhism and Jainism also thrived. Sanskrit
literature reached its peak with poets and scholars like Kalidasa and
Vishnu Sharma. Important works include Abhijnanashakuntalam and
Panchatantra. Science and mathematics advanced with contributions from
Aryabhata and Varahamihira. Astronomy, medicine, and metallurgy
developed significantly. Art and architecture flourished, exemplified by
the Ajanta caves, Sanchi stupa expansions, and temple architecture. The
period saw the codification of law and social norms. Gupta coinage,
especially gold coins, reflected artistic excellence. The empire
declined due to Hun invasions and weak successors. The Gupta era left a
lasting impact on Indian culture, politics, and intellectual traditions.

**Harshavardhana Period**

Harshavardhana ruled North India from 606 CE to 647 CE after the decline
of the Gupta Empire. He belonged to the Pushyabhuti dynasty and made
Kannauj his capital. Harsha unified small kingdoms in northern India
through diplomacy and military campaigns. He was a patron of Buddhism,
though he respected all religions, including Hinduism and Jainism.
Harsha organized large religious assemblies and distributed alms to
monks and the poor. His reign is described in the Harshacharita by
Banabhatta, highlighting his administration and generosity. Literature
and arts flourished under his patronage. The Chinese traveler Xuanzang
visited India during his reign and provided detailed accounts of Indian
society, administration, and religion. The administration was
centralized, with officials overseeing provinces, towns, and villages.
Trade, agriculture, and urban life prospered. After Harsha's death, his
empire fragmented into regional kingdoms. His period marked the
continuation of northern India's political and cultural developments
post-Gupta era.

**Sangam Period (South Indian Dynasties)**

The Sangam period (c. 3rd century BCE -- 3rd century CE) refers to the
early historical period of South India, primarily in Tamilakam. The
period is known through Sangam literature, which provides information on
society, polity, economy, and culture. The three major dynasties of the
period were the Cheras, Cholas, and Pandyas. These dynasties ruled
different regions: Cheras in Kerala, Cholas in the Kaveri delta, and
Pandyas in Tamil Nadu. Society was organized into clans and tribes, with
kings supported by ministers and local chieftains. Agriculture was the
main occupation, supplemented by trade, handicrafts, and pastoralism.
Trade, both inland and overseas, flourished with contacts with Rome, Sri
Lanka, and Southeast Asia. Sangam literature mentions towns, markets,
ports, and crafts, reflecting an urbanized economy. Religion included
worship of nature, early forms of Shaivism and Vaishnavism, and ancestor
worship. Literature during this period is divided into Ettuthokai (eight
anthologies) and Pattupattu (ten idylls). Poetry highlighted war, love,
heroism, and ethics. The period is notable for its patronage of arts,
culture, and Tamil language. Sangam inscriptions and coins provide
archaeological evidence of these dynasties. This period laid the
foundation for later South Indian kingdoms and cultural developments.

**2.Medieval India**

**Major Dynasties (750--1200 CE) of Early Medieval India**

The Early Medieval period (750--1200 CE) was marked by the rise of
powerful regional dynasties and political decentralization. The
**Gurjara-Pratiharas** ruled large parts of northern India with Kannauj
as their center and acted as a barrier against Arab invasions. The
**Palas** of Bengal and Bihar, founded by Gopala, patronized Buddhism
and made Nalanda and Vikramashila famous centers of learning. The
**Rashtrakutas** of the Deccan emerged as a dominant power, controlling
vast territories and promoting art and architecture, especially the
Kailasa temple at Ellora. In South India, the **Cholas** rose to
prominence, building a strong naval empire and an efficient
administrative system with village self-governance. The **Western
Chalukyas (Kalyani Chalukyas)** played a key role in Deccan politics and
culture. The **Eastern Chalukyas** ruled parts of Andhra and contributed
to temple architecture. The **Paramaras** of Malwa, under Bhoja, became
known for cultural achievements. The **Chandellas** built the famous
Khajuraho temples. The **Chauhans (Chahamanas)** controlled Rajasthan
and Haryana and resisted Turkish invasions. Overall, this period saw the
growth of feudalism, temple-centered economy, regional cultures, and
significant developments in art, architecture, and administration,
shaping medieval Indian history.

**Cholas and Other South Indian Kingdoms**

The **Cholas** emerged as a powerful dynasty in South India under
Vijayalaya and reached their zenith under **Rajaraja I** and **Rajendra
I**. They established a strong centralized administration supported by
an efficient revenue system and village self-governing institutions like
**sabha, ur,** and **nagaram.** The Cholas built a mighty navy and
expanded overseas influence to Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. Temple
architecture flourished, especially the **Brihadeshwara Temple at
Thanjavur**, reflecting Dravidian style. The **Pandyas** ruled the
southern Tamil region and were known for pearl fisheries and maritime
trade. The **Cheras** controlled the Malabar coast and played a key role
in spice trade with foreign countries. The **Pallavas**, with
Kanchipuram as their capital, patronized art and architecture, seen in
the rock-cut temples of Mahabalipuram. The **Western Chalukyas** and
**Hoysalas** dominated parts of Karnataka, with the Hoysalas
contributing unique temple styles at Belur and Halebidu. These kingdoms
promoted agriculture, irrigation, trade, Shaivism and Vaishnavism, and
significantly influenced South Indian culture, administration, and
architecture.

**Early Muslim Invasions**

The Early Muslim invasions marked the beginning of Islamic political and
cultural contact with India. The first major invasion was led by
**Muhammad bin Qasim** in 712 CE, resulting in the conquest of **Sindh**
during the Umayyad Caliphate. Arab rulers mainly focused on trade and
administration rather than large-scale territorial expansion in this
phase. From the 10th century, **Mahmud of Ghazni** conducted repeated
raids into India, primarily targeting wealthy temples like **Somnath**
to acquire wealth and assert political dominance. These invasions
weakened the power of north Indian kingdoms such as the Pratiharas.
Later, **Muhammad Ghori** launched systematic military campaigns aimed
at permanent conquest rather than plunder. His victories over the
**Chauhans** in the Battles of Tarain (1191 and 1192) laid the
foundation for Muslim rule in North India. The establishment of Turkish
rule was completed by Ghori's generals, especially **Qutbuddin Aibak,**
who founded the Delhi Sultanate. Overall, these invasions led to
political change, new administrative practices, military techniques, and
long-term cultural interactions between India and the Islamic world.

**The Delhi Sultanate (1206--1526 AD)**

The **Delhi Sultanate** was established in 1206 AD by **Qutbuddin
Aibak**, marking the beginning of Turkish rule in India. It consisted of
five major dynasties: the **Slave (Mamluk), Khalji, Tughlaq, Sayyid**,
and **Lodi** dynasties. The Slave rulers, especially **Iltutmish** and
**Balban**, consolidated the Sultanate and strengthened central
authority. The Khaljis, under **Alauddin Khalji,** expanded the empire
into the Deccan and introduced important economic reforms such as market
control and price regulation. The Tughlaqs attempted ambitious
administrative experiments; **Muhammad bin Tughlaq's** policies often
failed, while **Firoz Shah Tughlaq** focused on public works and welfare
measures. The Sultanate faced constant challenges from Mongol invasions,
internal rebellions, and provincial governors. Administration was based
on the **iqta system**, with land revenues assigned to officials.
Persian became the court language, and new military techniques were
introduced. Art and architecture developed with structures like **Qutub
Minar** and **Alai Darwaza**. The Delhi Sultanate ended in 1526 after
**Babur's victory over Ibrahim Lodi** at the First Battle of Panipat,
paving the way for the Mughal Empire.

**Struggle for Empire in North India (Afghans, Rajputs, and Mughals)**

The 16th century in North India was marked by intense struggles between
**Afghans, Rajputs, and emerging Mughal power**. After the decline of
the Delhi Sultanate**, Afghan rulers,** including the Lodi dynasty and
regional chieftains like **Sher Shah Suri,** controlled large
territories. The **Rajputs**, led by clans such as the **Rathores,
Sisodias, and Chauhans**, maintained strongholds in Rajasthan and
resisted external invasions fiercely. The Mughals, starting with
**Babur's invasion in 1526,** established imperial authority after the
**First Battle of Panipat**, defeating Ibrahim Lodi. Babur faced stiff
resistance from Rajputs but secured Delhi and Agra, laying the
foundation for Mughal dominance. **Humayun** struggled against Afghan
rulers like Sher Shah Suri, who temporarily established the **Sur
Empire**, introducing efficient administration, the **currency system**,
and the **road network**. Akbar later reconciled with Rajputs through
diplomacy and matrimonial alliances, integrating them into the Mughal
administration. This period saw consolidation of central authority,
military innovations, and the blending of Afghan, Rajput, and Mughal
political and cultural practices, setting the stage for the Mughal
Empire's expansion

**The Establishment of the North Indian Empire**

The North Indian Empire was firmly established with **Babur's victory at
the First Battle of Panipat in 1526,** which marked the beginning of the
**Mughal Empire**. Babur used superior **artillery and military
tactics** to defeat the Lodi dynasty. After consolidating Delhi and
Agra, he faced challenges from regional rulers and Rajputs but laid the
foundation for centralized Mughal rule. **Humayun,** his son, struggled
initially against Afghan and regional powers and was temporarily exiled
by **Sher Shah Suri**, who established the **Sur Empire** and introduced
efficient revenue and administrative systems. Humayun regained the
throne in 1555 but died soon after. **Akbar (1556--1605),** Humayun's
son, consolidated the empire through military expansion, diplomacy, and
alliances, especially with Rajputs. He introduced a **centralized
administrative system,** revenue reforms under **Todar Mal,** and
promoted **religious tolerance.** Akbar's reign marked the
transformation of the Mughal state into a powerful, stable empire with a
structured bureaucracy, military efficiency, and flourishing cultural
and architectural achievements.

**Consolidation and Expansion of the Empire -- Akbar**

**Akbar** was one of the greatest Mughal emperors who consolidated and
expanded the empire in North and Central India. He ascended the throne
at a young age and, with the guidance of **Bairam Khan,** stabilized the
empire through efficient administration and military organization. Akbar
defeated powerful regional rulers, including **Hemu in the Second Battle
of Panipat (1556),** and annexed territories like **Rajputana, Gujarat,
Bengal, and Malwa.** He maintained alliances with Rajput rulers through
matrimonial ties, integrating them into the Mughal nobility and army.
His **centralized administration** divided the empire into provinces
(**subahs**) headed by governors (**subahdars**) and implemented a
uniform revenue system (**Ain-i-Dahsala**) under **Todar Mal**. Akbar
encouraged cultural synthesis, promoted **religious tolerance,** and
abolished discriminatory taxes like **jizya**. He patronized art,
architecture, literature, and learning, leading to the flourishing of
Mughal culture. Through diplomacy, military strength, and administrative
reforms, Akbar transformed the Mughal Empire into a strong, unified, and
prosperous state.

**State and Government under Akbar**

Akbar established a highly **centralized and efficient administrative
system** to govern the Mughal Empire. The empire was divided into
**subahs (provinces),** each headed by a **subahdar (governor),**
assisted by officials responsible for revenue, law, and military
affairs. The **central government** included key departments like
**Diwan (finance), Mir Bakshi (military), Qazi (justice), and
Ariz-i-Mamalik (army organization).** Akbar introduced the **mansabdari
system,** assigning **military and civil ranks (mansabs)** to nobles,
linking their position with revenue and military responsibilities.
Revenue administration was standardized through **Todar Mal's land
revenue system (Ain-i-Dahsala),** ensuring regular collection and
reducing corruption. Akbar also promoted **judicial reforms**, with
Islamic law supplemented by customary local laws, and encouraged
**religious tolerance.** The emperor held **absolute authority**, but
governance relied on cooperation with **nobility, Rajput allies, and
provincial administrators,** creating a strong and cohesive state
machinery. This system laid the foundation for Mughal political
stability and expansion.

**Akbar's Religious Views**

Akbar is known for his **policy of religious tolerance and
inclusivity.** He promoted harmony among the diverse religious
communities of his empire, including **Hindus, Muslims, Jains, and
Christians.** He abolished the **jizya (tax on non-Muslims)** in 1564,
showing his commitment to equality. Akbar engaged in **interfaith
dialogues** at the **Ibadat Khana** in Fatehpur Sikri, inviting
scholars, theologians, and philosophers from different religions. He
also developed his own **syncretic belief system**, the **Din-i-Ilahi,**
combining elements of Islam, Hinduism, Jainism, and Zoroastrianism,
though it remained limited to a small circle of courtiers. Akbar
patronized **religious literature, translations of scriptures,** and
supported temples and mosques alike. His approach helped integrate
diverse communities, strengthen the Mughal state, and foster social
cohesion, making his reign a model of **pluralism and cultural
synthesis** in Indian history.

**The Deccan and the Mughals (Up to 1657)**

By the early 17th century, the **Mughal Empire** expanded southward into
the **Deccan plateau,** encountering established regional powers like
the **Bijapur, Golconda, Ahmadnagar, and the Marathas. Akbar** initiated
campaigns to bring the Deccan under control but faced strong resistance
and logistical challenges. His successors, including **Jahangir and Shah
Jahan**, continued Mughal efforts, focusing on **territorial
consolidation, tribute collection, and political alliances** with Deccan
sultanates. **Aurangzeb**, as a governor and later emperor, intensified
campaigns against the Deccan kingdoms, including prolonged wars with
**Bijapur and Golconda,** aiming for full annexation. These campaigns
were costly and required significant military resources, highlighting
the strategic and economic importance of the region. The Deccan wars
influenced Mughal administrative practices, integration policies, and
the empire's fiscal and military strategies, setting the stage for later
conflicts with the emerging **Maratha power** after 1657.

**Foreign Policy of the Mughals**

The Mughal Empire maintained a **pragmatic and strategic foreign
policy** to secure its borders, trade, and political influence. Babur
focused on consolidating North India rather than foreign expansion.
Akbar established **diplomatic relations** with regional powers in
Central Asia, Persia, and the Deccan, often using **marriage alliances,
gifts, and envoys** to maintain peace. Trade relations were encouraged
with **European powers** like the Portuguese, and later the Dutch and
English, particularly for access to ports and luxury goods. The empire
often engaged in **tributary relations** with neighboring kingdoms,
ensuring political loyalty without direct annexation. Military campaigns
were conducted cautiously in border areas to prevent threats from
**Afghans, Rajputs, and Deccan sultanates.** Under Aurangzeb, foreign
policy became more aggressive in the Deccan, focusing on **annexation
and consolidation.** Overall, Mughal foreign policy combined diplomacy,
military strength, and economic considerations to maintain imperial
stability and regional supremacy.

**India in the First Half of the Seventeenth Century (1600--1657)**

The first half of the 17th century in India was dominated by the
**Mughal Empire**, which had reached its peak under **Jahangir
(1605--1627)** and **Shah Jahan (1628--1658).** The empire maintained
**political stability, economic prosperity, and cultural flourishing**.
Mughal administration continued the **mansabdari system** and effective
revenue collection. Trade, both internal and overseas, expanded
significantly, with the **Portuguese, Dutch, English, and French**
establishing commercial settlements along the coasts. The period saw
remarkable **art, architecture, and literature,** exemplified by the
construction of the **Taj Mahal** and the patronage of painting and
poetry. Regional powers like the **Deccan sultanates, Rajputs, and
Marathas** retained autonomy but often allied with or paid tribute to
the Mughals. Religious policy emphasized tolerance under Jahangir and
early Shah Jahan, though later in his reign there were stricter measures
against some non-Muslim communities. Overall, this period laid the
foundation for Mughal cultural, economic, and territorial dominance in
India.

**Climax and Crisis of the Mughal Empire: The Marathas and the Deccan**

The later Mughal Empire reached its **climax under Aurangzeb
(1658--1707)** but faced severe challenges in the **Deccan and from the
Marathas**. Aurangzeb conducted prolonged campaigns to annex the
**Deccan sultanates** of Bijapur and Golconda, which drained imperial
resources and manpower. The rise of the **Marathas under Shivaji** posed
a significant challenge with guerrilla warfare, mobility, and control
over forts, gradually undermining Mughal authority in the region. The
empire also faced **administrative strains, revenue collection issues,
and local rebellions.** Despite military successes, the continuous wars
in the Deccan weakened central control and exposed vulnerabilities in
governance. Aurangzeb's policies led to regional fragmentation and the
emergence of powerful autonomous states. The period highlighted the
**limits of Mughal expansion,** marking the beginning of a slow decline
that intensified after Aurangzeb's death in 1707, with the **Marathas
consolidating power** in western and central India.

**The Marathas and Other Indian States and Society in the 18th Century**

The 18th century in India saw the **decline of the Mughal Empire** and
the rise of regional powers, with the **Marathas emerging as the
dominant force** in western, central, and parts of northern India. Under
leaders like **Shivaji, Peshwas, and later Maratha chiefs,** they
established a confederacy with semi-autonomous states, effective revenue
administration, and a strong military based on cavalry and guerrilla
tactics. Other significant regional powers included the **Nawabs of
Bengal, Hyderabad, Awadh, Mysore, and Rajput states,** each
consolidating local authority and revenues. Society in this period was
**agrarian-based,** with feudal land relations, and communities often
organized around caste, religion, and local governance. Trade and craft
production flourished in towns, while European powers, especially the
**British, French, and Dutch,** expanded commercial and territorial
influence. Cultural developments continued with **temple construction,
regional literature, and art,** reflecting a blend of local and Mughal
traditions. The period set the stage for **colonial intervention** and
eventual British dominance by the late 18th century.

**Vijayanagar Empire**

The **Vijayanagar Empire** was established in 1336 by **Harihara I and
Bukka Raya I** in southern India to resist **Muslim invasions from the
north** and to consolidate the Hindu south. The empire's capital,
**Vijayanagar (Hampi),** became a major political, economic, and
cultural center. The rulers maintained a **strong centralized
administration** with provincial governors and promoted efficient
revenue collection. Vijayanagar's economy was based on **agriculture,
trade, and tribute from subordinate states**, and it maintained **strong
military forces,** including elephants and cavalry, to defend its
territory. The empire fostered **temple architecture,** patronized art,
literature, and music, and supported **religious and cultural
activities**. Trade links extended to **Arab, Persian, and Portuguese
merchants,** facilitating wealth accumulation. The empire reached its
**zenith under Krishnadevaraya**, who expanded territory, strengthened
administration, and encouraged cultural synthesis. Decline began after
the **Battle of Talikota (1565)** against the Deccan sultanates, which
led to the eventual collapse of centralized authority, though regional
powers continued under Vijayanagar legacy.

**Regional States in the Medieval Period**

During the medieval period, India witnessed the rise of **regional
states** due to the **decline of centralized power** after the Gupta and
early medieval empires. In **North India**, the **Gurjara-Pratiharas,
Palas, and Rashtrakutas** dominated different regions, often engaged in
rivalry for control of strategic territories. In **South India,** the
**Cholas, Pandyas, Cheras, Pallavas, and Hoysalas** developed strong
kingdoms with efficient administration, maritime trade, and cultural
patronage. The **Cholas** expanded overseas influence to Sri Lanka and
Southeast Asia, while **temple-centered economies** flourished in the
South. In the Deccan, the **Western and Eastern Chalukyas** and later
**Bahmani Sultanate** consolidated regional authority. These states
maintained armies, collected revenues through land and trade, and
encouraged art, architecture, and literature. Feudal relationships
became prominent, with local chieftains controlling villages and
fortresses. The rise of regional states facilitated **cultural
diversity, economic development, and political decentralization,**
laying the groundwork for future empires like the Delhi Sultanate and
the Mughals.

**Northern India in the First Half of the Eighteenth Century**

The first half of the 18th century saw Northern India in political
transition following the death of Aurangzeb in 1707. The Mughal Empire
weakened, with emperors losing control over provinces to powerful
regional governors and nobles. The Marathas emerged as a dominant force,
extending influence into Malwa, Gujarat, and Delhi, often acting as
kingmakers at the Mughal court. Other regional powers included the
Nawabs of Bengal, Awadh, and Rohilkhand, who consolidated authority
locally while nominally acknowledging Mughal suzerainty. Rajput states
retained autonomy but engaged in shifting alliances with Mughals and
Marathas. The period was marked by frequent conflicts, invasions, and
shifting loyalties, including incursions by Afghans like Nadir Shah
(1739), which further weakened Mughal prestige. Economically,
agriculture remained dominant, while towns and trade centers prospered.
Socially and culturally, the era continued Mughal traditions in art,
architecture, and literature, but with increasing regional flavors,
reflecting the fragmentation and regionalization of power in North
India.

**Society -- Structure and Growth**

Medieval Indian society was **hierarchical, agrarian, and diverse**,
shaped by **regional, religious, and occupational distinctions.** The
**village remained the basic unit,** governed by local assemblies like
**panchayats**, which managed land, resources, and disputes. Society was
largely **rural,** with peasants, artisans, and landlords forming the
backbone of the economy. The **caste system (varna and jati)**
structured social interactions, occupations, and status, while **tribal
communities** maintained autonomy in forests and hills. Urban centers
grew as **trade, crafts, and markets flourished**, connecting India to
internal and overseas trade networks. The growth of towns fostered
**art, architecture, education, and religious institutions,** including
temples, mosques, and madrasas. Religion played a central role, with
**Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, and Sikhism** influencing social norms and
cultural life. Military and administrative elites, including Rajputs,
Mughals, and regional rulers, shaped political and social hierarchies.
Over time, **regional diversity, mobility, and patronage** allowed
society to adapt and expand, reflecting a dynamic blend of tradition and
change.

**Economic Life-Patterns and Prospects**

Medieval India's economy was primarily **agrarian**, with agriculture
forming the backbone of production and revenue. Land revenue was
collected through **local intermediaries, zamindars, or the
iqta/mansabdari system**, depending on the ruling power. **Irrigation
and cultivation techniques** improved under regional kingdoms and the
Mughals, supporting crop diversity including rice, wheat, cotton, and
sugarcane. **Trade** flourished both internally and externally; towns
and ports became commercial hubs, linking India to **Central Asia, the
Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Europe. Crafts and cottage
industries,** such as textiles, metalwork, and pottery, thrived under
state patronage. The **monetary economy** expanded, with coins
facilitating trade, taxation, and savings. Guilds and merchant
communities regulated production, prices, and labor. The economy was
influenced by **political stability, invasions, and taxation policies,**
which could either stimulate or disrupt growth. Overall, despite
regional variations, medieval India's economy demonstrated **resilience,
adaptability, and prospects for sustained trade and agrarian
expansion.**

**3.Modern History**

**The Advent of Europeans In India**

The advent of Europeans in India began in the late 15th and early 16th
centuries. The Portuguese were the first Europeans to establish a
presence, with Vasco da Gama reaching Calicut in 1498. They established
trading posts and forts along the western coast, including Goa, Daman,
and Diu. The Portuguese controlled spice trade and aimed to monopolize
maritime commerce. In the early 17th century, the Dutch and the English
arrived, followed by the French. The English established the East India
Company in 1600, initially for trade in spices, textiles, and other
goods. The French East India Company was set up in 1664 and controlled
parts of Pondicherry and Chandannagar. The Europeans established
settlements, forts, and trading networks along the coasts. They
gradually interfered in local politics, forming alliances with regional
rulers. Conflicts among Europeans, such as the Anglo-French rivalry,
affected Indian kingdoms. The Europeans introduced new administrative
practices, military technology, and commercial methods. Their arrival
marked the beginning of European colonial influence in India, setting
the stage for later British dominance.

**British Expansion in India**

The British expansion in India took place gradually from the early 18th
century to the mid-19th century. After the Battle of Plassey in 1757,
the British East India Company gained control over Bengal under Robert
Clive. The Battle of Buxar in 1764 further strengthened their political
and revenue authority in eastern India. The Company expanded through
wars, annexations, and treaties with Indian rulers. Key conflicts
included the Anglo-Mysore Wars against Tipu Sultan, the Anglo-Maratha
Wars, and the Anglo-Sikh Wars. Subsidiary alliances, introduced by Lord
Wellesley, allowed the British to control princely states without direct
annexation. The Doctrine of Lapse under Lord Dalhousie led to the
annexation of states with no male heir, such as Satara and Jhansi. The
British controlled trade, revenue collection, and administration in
their territories. They established railways, telegraphs, and postal
systems to consolidate power. Indian society and economy were impacted
by colonial policies, including the Permanent Settlement in Bengal. By
the mid-19th century, almost the entire Indian subcontinent came under
British control, laying the foundation for direct colonial rule after
1858.

**Administration before 1857**

Before 1857, India was largely administered by the British East India
Company. The Company combined commercial activities with political
control. The administration was divided into three main Presidencies:
Bengal, Madras, and Bombay, each headed by a Governor or
Governor-General. The Governor-General of Bengal became the
Governor-General of India after the Regulating Act of 1773, with
oversight over other presidencies. Administrative functions included
revenue collection, law and order, and trade regulation. Revenue systems
like the Permanent Settlement in Bengal, Ryotwari in Madras and Bombay,
and Mahalwari in North-Western provinces were introduced. The Company
relied on Indian officials called zemindars, deshmukhs, and village
headmen for local administration. Judicial powers were exercised through
civil and criminal courts. Military control was maintained by Company
armies, including sepoys. The Company collected taxes to fund
administration and military expenses. Policies favored trade monopolies,
especially in textiles and spices. Education and social reforms were
limited but gradually introduced by the early 19th century. The
administrative structure was primarily centralized, with strict
oversight from London. Widespread discontent over revenue policies,
military grievances, and social issues contributed to the Revolt of
1857. The revolt marked the end of Company rule and the beginning of
direct British Crown administration in India.

**Economic Policies of The British**

The British economic policies in India were designed to serve British
interests, often at the expense of local economy. Agriculture was
heavily taxed, with systems like Permanent Settlement in Bengal,
Ryotwari in Madras and Bombay, and Mahalwari in North-Western Provinces.
These policies burdened peasants and disrupted traditional agrarian
relations. India was transformed into a supplier of raw materials (like
cotton, jute, indigo, and opium) for British industries. British
policies discouraged local handicrafts and cottage industries, leading
to deindustrialization. Railways, roads, and ports were developed
primarily to facilitate trade of raw materials and military movement.
British introduced modern banking, insurance, and currency systems, but
these largely benefited colonial trade. India became a major market for
British manufactured goods, including textiles. The drain of wealth
theory highlighted the transfer of Indian resources to Britain through
trade surplus, taxes, and profits of British companies. Famines occurred
frequently due to revenue pressures and export-oriented policies. Trade
monopolies, especially in opium and salt, increased British control over
the economy. These economic policies caused stagnation in agriculture,
decline of traditional industries, and widespread poverty. The policies
laid the foundation for economic exploitation, which fueled nationalist
movements and demands for self-rule.

**Impact of British Administration**

The British administration in India had far-reaching social, economic,
and political effects. Politically, they centralized power, introduced a
uniform administrative system, and established a bureaucracy modeled on
the British system. They codified laws through acts like the Indian
Penal Code (1860) and established civil and criminal courts.
Economically, British policies led to the deindustrialization of
traditional crafts and handicrafts and turned India into a supplier of
raw materials and a market for British goods. Revenue systems like
Permanent Settlement, Ryotwari, and Mahalwari burdened peasants and
caused frequent famines. Infrastructure such as railways, roads, ports,
and telegraphs was developed, primarily to serve colonial trade and
military needs. Education was introduced on a Western model, promoting
English language and modern sciences, but literacy remained limited.
Social reforms included outlawing practices like Sati and promoting
widow remarriage, though these were unevenly implemented. The British
also encouraged missionary activity and Christian education.
Urbanization and growth of towns accelerated under colonial rule.
Administrative reforms created a class of Indian clerks, professionals,
and elites who later became part of the nationalist movement. Overall,
British administration modernized certain aspects of governance and
infrastructure but exploited India economically and socially, leading to
widespread discontent and eventually the struggle for independence.

**The Revolt Of 1857**

The Revolt of 1857, also called the First War of Indian Independence,
was a major uprising against British East India Company rule. It began
in Meerut on 10 May 1857 and spread to northern and central India. Key
causes included political, economic, social, and military grievances.
Political causes were the Doctrine of Lapse, annexation of Indian
states, and loss of power of traditional rulers. Economic causes
included high taxes, exploitation of peasants, and deindustrialization.
Social and religious causes included interference in religious practices
and fears of forced conversions. Military causes involved low pay, harsh
discipline, and the introduction of the Enfield rifle cartridges rumored
to be greased with cow and pig fat, offending both Hindu and Muslim
soldiers. Major centers of revolt included Delhi, Kanpur, Lucknow,
Jhansi, Bareilly, and Awadh. Leaders like Mangal Pandey, Rani
Lakshmibai, Nana Sahib, Begum Hazrat Mahal, and Kunwar Singh played
prominent roles. The revolt saw widespread participation from sepoys,
peasants, artisans, and rulers. The British suppressed the revolt by
1858, with heavy casualties on both sides. Its consequences included the
end of Company rule and the beginning of direct British Crown rule under
the Government of India Act 1858. The revolt marked the beginning of
organized resistance and inspired later freedom movements.

**Administrative Changes After 1857**

After the Revolt of 1857, the British Crown took direct control of
India, ending the East India Company's rule through the Government of
India Act, 1858. The Governor-General of Bengal became the Viceroy of
India, representing the British monarch. The administration became more
centralized, with clear divisions between executive and legislative
powers. The Indian Civil Services (ICS) was strengthened, with British
officers holding key administrative positions, while Indians were
gradually allowed limited entry. The army was reorganized to prevent
future mutinies, with increased recruitment of soldiers from so-called
"loyal" communities. Policies emphasized loyalty of princely states,
often through subsidiary alliances and guarantees of internal autonomy.
The British introduced the law and order system with codified laws and
police reforms. Revenue collection methods were retained, but greater
attention was given to avoiding peasant unrest. Infrastructure
development---railways, telegraphs, and roads---was accelerated to
improve administrative efficiency. Education policies promoted English
education while supporting limited vernacular instruction. The British
also focused on social reforms cautiously to prevent unrest. Overall,
administration became more systematic, centralized, and oriented toward
consolidating imperial control and preventing further revolts.

**Development of Civil Services**

The civil services in India evolved under British rule to administer the
vast territories efficiently. Initially, the East India Company relied
on its officials for both revenue collection and administration. The
Regulating Act of 1773 and Pitt's India Act of 1784 formalized
administrative structures and oversight from Britain. The Indian Civil
Service (ICS) was established to recruit trained officers for higher
administration. Recruitment was initially dominated by British
officials, often through competitive exams held in London. Over time,
Indians were gradually allowed to enter, with reforms like the Indian
Councils Act 1861 and later civil service reforms. The ICS officers held
key positions in revenue, law, and administration, and formed the
backbone of the colonial bureaucracy. District officers, collectors, and
magistrates exercised both executive and judicial powers. Local
administration relied on zamindars, village headmen, and municipal
bodies under British supervision. The ICS was highly prestigious and
played a central role in implementing British policies. After
independence, the ICS evolved into the Indian Administrative Service
(IAS) under the Constitution of India. For UPSC Prelims, focus on its
origin, structure, recruitment, and role in administration.

**Development of Education**

Education in India under British rule evolved gradually, influenced by
administrative, social, and economic objectives. Initially, the British
supported traditional indigenous education through pathshalas, madrasas,
and gurukuls. The Charter Act of 1813 marked the beginning of state
support for education in India. The Macaulay Minute of 1835 emphasized
English education and Western knowledge, aiming to create a class of
intermediaries. Lord William Bentinck promoted English education in
higher studies, while Thomas Babington Macaulay influenced curriculum
policies. The Wood's Dispatch of 1854 laid the foundation for modern
education, recommending a system of primary, secondary, and higher
education, teacher training, and universities. The first universities
were established in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras in 1857. Education
policy focused on administration, law, and literature, with limited
focus on technical and vocational training initially. Missionary
societies also contributed to spreading education, especially among
girls and marginalized communities. Vernacular education was promoted
gradually to increase literacy. Literacy rates remained low, but urban
education expanded, creating a class of educated Indians. Technical
institutes, medical colleges, and professional education developed in
the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Education became a tool for
social reform, awareness, and eventual nationalist movements. For UPSC
Prelims, focus on key acts, policies, and the establishment of
universities.

**Development of Press**

The development of the press in India began during the British colonial
period. The first newspaper, Hicky's Bengal Gazette, was published in
1780 in Calcutta by James Augustus Hicky. Early newspapers were mostly
in English and served the interests of British officials and traders.
Indian-language newspapers emerged in the 19th century, including Bengal
Gazette in Bengali and publications in Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, and Urdu.
The press played a significant role in spreading social and political
awareness, education, and reformist ideas. During the 19th century,
newspapers became a platform for debate on social reforms, such as
abolition of Sati, widow remarriage, and education. By the late 19th and
early 20th centuries, the press became an important tool for nationalist
movements. Newspapers like The Hindu, Amrita Bazar Patrika, Kesari, and
The Indian Spectator voiced criticism of British policies. The
Vernacular Press Act of 1878 attempted to curb freedom of the press,
especially in Indian languages, but was later repealed due to public
protests. The press helped mobilize public opinion during movements like
the Swadeshi Movement and later freedom struggles. For UPSC Prelims,
focus on the first newspapers, vernacular press, and key legislation
like the Vernacular Press Act.

**Socio-Religious Reforms**

Socio-religious reform movements in India emerged during the 19th and
early 20th centuries, influenced by British rule, Western education, and
exposure to modern ideas. Reformers aimed to eradicate social evils,
promote education, and revive ethical values. Raja Ram Mohan Roy founded
the Brahmo Samaj (1828) to fight against Sati, child marriage, and caste
discrimination while promoting rationalism and modern education.
Dayananda Saraswati established the Arya Samaj (1875), emphasizing Vedic
teachings, promotion of Hindi, and social reforms like widow remarriage.
Swami Vivekananda promoted spiritual revival and upliftment through
Vedantic ideas and social service. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar worked for
widow remarriage and female education in Bengal. Jyotirao Phule and
Savitribai Phule championed education for women and lower castes in
Maharashtra. Ramakrishna Mission, Prarthana Samaj, and Theosophical
Society also contributed to education, social upliftment, and
inter-religious harmony. Reform movements opposed untouchability, caste
rigidity, and superstitions. They promoted women's rights, literacy, and
moral values. These movements created awareness, laid the foundation for
modern Indian society, and influenced nationalist thought. For UPSC
Prelims, focus on key reformers, their organizations, and major social
reforms.

3.  These uprisings laid the foundation for later organized nationalist
    movements.

**Revolutionary Nationalism**

Revolutionary nationalism emerged in India in the late 19th and early
20th centuries as a militant response to British colonial rule. Unlike
moderate nationalists, revolutionaries believed in direct action,
including armed struggle, to overthrow the British. They were inspired
by patriotism, social reform, and anti-colonial sentiment, and focused
on secret societies, bombings, and assassinations of British officials.
Important organizations included the Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar in
Bengal, the Abhinav Bharat Society in Maharashtra, and the Ghadar Party
among Indian immigrants in the USA. Notable leaders were Bhagat Singh,
Chandrashekhar Azad, Khudiram Bose, Rash Behari Bose, and Aurobindo
Ghosh. Key events included the Alipore Bomb Case (1908), Kakori Train
Robbery (1925), and the assassination of Saunders (1928). These
revolutionary activities created fear among British authorities,
inspired mass nationalist sentiment, and encouraged youth participation
in the freedom struggle. While their methods were militant, they
complemented moderate and Gandhian movements, strengthening the overall
fight for India's independence. For UPSC Prelims, emphasis should be on
leaders, organizations, events, and regional significance.

**Indian National Movement -- I (1905-1918)**

The period 1905--1918 was marked by the rise of the Extremist and
Moderate phases of the Indian National Congress, and significant events
that shaped the freedom struggle. The partition of Bengal in 1905 by
Lord Curzon sparked widespread protest and gave rise to the Swadeshi and
Boycott Movements, emphasizing indigenous goods and self-reliance.
Extremist leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai, and Bipin
Chandra Pal advocated assertive methods, while moderates preferred
petitions and dialogue with the British. The Indian National Congress
split in 1907 into Moderates and Extremists at the Surat session.
Revolutionary nationalism also gained momentum during this period, with
secret societies and armed resistance in Bengal, Punjab, and
Maharashtra. The Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909 introduced limited
representation for Indians in legislative councils. During World War I
(1914--1918), India supported the British, hoping for constitutional
concessions after the war. Leaders like Gopal Krishna Gokhale and
Surendranath Banerjee played crucial roles in political reforms. Social
and labor movements also began emerging alongside political protests.
The period laid the foundation for mass movements under Gandhi in later
years. For UPSC Prelims, focus on Bengal Partition, Swadeshi Movement,
Extremist leaders, revolutionary activities, and key reforms.

**Indian National Movement --II (1918-1929)**

The period 1918--1929 marked the beginning of mass movements under
Mahatma Gandhi and the rise of non-cooperation as a political strategy.
After World War I, Indians became discontented due to high taxes,
unemployment, and repressive policies. The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre
(1919) in Amritsar intensified anti-British sentiment. The Rowlatt Act
(1919) and repressive laws sparked widespread protests. Mahatma Gandhi
launched the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920--1922), promoting boycott of
British goods, institutions, and titles, along with promotion of Khadi
and Swadeshi ideals. The movement mobilized peasants, students, and
women on a large scale. The Chauri Chaura incident (1922) led Gandhi to
suspend the movement due to violence. During this period, peasant
movements in Punjab, Bihar, and Awadh gained momentum. Revolutionary
activities continued in Bengal and Punjab, with leaders like Bhagat
Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad, and Rash Behari Bose. The Simon Commission
(1927), which excluded Indians, triggered nationwide protests. The Nehru
Report (1928) demanded dominion status and constitutional reforms. This
period also witnessed the rise of youth and student activism and
consolidation of Congress as a mass-based party. For UPSC Prelims, focus
on key movements, Gandhi's leadership, revolutionary nationalism, and
constitutional developments.

**Indian National Movement -- III (1930-1947)**

The period 1930--1947 marked the final phase of India's struggle for
independence, characterized by mass movements, civil disobedience, and
negotiations with the British. The Civil Disobedience Movement
(1930--1934), launched by Mahatma Gandhi after the Salt March (Dandi
March, 1930), aimed to defy British laws non-violently and promote
Swadeshi. It witnessed widespread participation of peasants, workers,
and women. The Round Table Conferences (1930--1932) discussed
constitutional reforms, but failed to satisfy Indian aspirations. The
Government of India Act 1935 provided provincial autonomy and expanded
legislative councils, but fell short of full self-rule. During World War
II (1939--1945), the Congress opposed India's involuntary involvement,
leading to the Quit India Movement (1942), demanding immediate British
withdrawal. Revolutionary and militant activities continued in regions
like Bengal and Punjab. Communal tensions rose, eventually contributing
to the partition of India in 1947. The period also saw negotiations
between the Congress, Muslim League, and British, culminating in the
Indian Independence Act 1947. For UPSC Prelims, focus on Civil
Disobedience, Salt March, Quit India Movement, constitutional reforms,
key leaders, and independence events.

**Governor Generals During British India**

**Governor of Bengal (Before 1773):** The British East India Company
appointed Governors to administer Bengal, primarily overseeing trade,
revenue collection, and company interests.

**Governor-Generals of Bengal (1773--1833):** Established under the
Regulating Act of 1773, Warren Hastings became the first
Governor-General of Bengal. This period saw increasing British political
and administrative control in India, with Governor-Generals like Lord
Cornwallis introducing revenue reforms and judicial reorganization.

**Governor-Generals of India (1833--1858):** The Charter Act of 1833
centralized power, making the Governor-General of Bengal the
Governor-General of India, giving them authority over all British
territories. Key figures included Lord Wellesley, who expanded
territories through the Subsidiary Alliance, and Lord Dalhousie, known
for the Doctrine of Lapse and infrastructure development.

**Viceroy and Governor-Generals of India (1858--1947):** After the 1857
Revolt, the British Crown assumed direct control. The Governor-General
became the Viceroy, representing the monarch. Key Viceroys include Lord
Canning (handled 1857 revolt), Lord Curzon (administrative and
educational reforms, Partition of Bengal), and Lord Mountbatten, who
oversaw India's independence and partition in 1947.

**Warren Hastings (1773--1785)** -- First Governor-General of Bengal
under the Regulating Act of 1773; introduced judicial and administrative
reforms.

**Lord Cornwallis (1786--1793)** -- Introduced permanent settlement of
Bengal, reformed revenue and judicial systems.

**Lord Wellesley (1798--1805)** -- Expanded British territories in India
through Subsidiary Alliance system.

**Lord Hastings (1813--1823)** -- Consolidated British control in India;
defeated Marathas in the Third Anglo-Maratha War.

**Lord Dalhousie (1848--1856)** -- Introduced Doctrine of Lapse, railway
expansion, telegraph, postal reforms, and administrative modernization.

**Lord Canning (1856--1862)** -- Governor-General during the 1857
Revolt; became first Viceroy under the Government of India Act 1858.

**Lord Curzon (1899--1905)** -- Reorganized administration, introduced
partition of Bengal (1905), and promoted education and archaeology.

**Lord Mountbatten (1947)** -- Last Viceroy of India; oversaw
independence and partition of India.

**Constitutional Development in India**

Constitutional development in India under British rule was a gradual
process shaped by a series of legislative acts and reforms. It began
with the Regulating Act of 1773, which established the office of
Governor-General of Bengal and increased government control over the
East India Company. The Pitt's India Act of 1784 strengthened British
supervision through the Board of Control. The Charter Acts of 1813,
1833, and 1853 expanded education, centralized administration, and
allowed limited Indian entry into civil services. After the Revolt of
1857, the Government of India Act 1858 transferred power to the British
Crown, making the Governor-General the Viceroy. The Indian Councils Acts
of 1861 and 1892 gradually increased Indian representation in
legislative bodies. The Morley-Minto Reforms (1909) introduced separate
electorates for Muslims, while the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms (1919)
brought dyarchy in provinces. The Government of India Act 1935 provided
provincial autonomy, bicameral legislatures, and a federal framework but
fell short of full independence. Finally, the Indian Independence Act
1947 ended British rule, partitioning India and Pakistan. For UPSC
Prelims, emphasis should be on key acts, reforms, and their impact on
governance and Indian participation.

**INDIAN CULTURE**

**1.Visual Arts**

**Architecture**

Indian architecture reflects the cultural, religious, and historical
evolution of India. Early Indian architecture developed from rock-cut
caves, stupas, and temples using stone and brick. Temple architecture
evolved into three main styles: Nagara in North India, Dravida in South
India, and Vesara in the Deccan region. Nagara temples have curvilinear
shikharas, while Dravida temples feature pyramidal vimanas and large
gopurams. Indo-Islamic architecture emerged after the 12th century with
the arrival of Turks and Mughals. It introduced features like arches,
domes, minarets, mihrabs, and geometric designs. The Delhi Sultanate
period saw structures like Qutub Minar and Alai Darwaza. Mughal
architecture reached its peak under Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and
Aurangzeb. It combined Persian, Islamic, and Indian elements. Use of red
sandstone, marble, charbagh gardens, and symmetry became prominent.
Famous examples include the Taj Mahal, Red Fort, and Jama Masjid.
Regional Indo-Islamic styles developed in Bengal, Deccan, and Gujarat.
Modern Indian architecture began during British rule. It introduced
European styles such as Gothic, Neo-Classical, and Indo-Saracenic.
Post-independence architecture emphasized functionality and modern
materials. Architects like Le Corbusier influenced city planning, as
seen in Chandigarh. Overall, Indian architecture shows continuity,
adaptation, and cultural synthesis.

**Sculptures**

sculpture is one of the earliest and most important forms of visual art
in India. It began in the prehistoric period with terracotta and stone
figures. The Indus Valley Civilization produced realistic sculptures
like the Dancing Girl and the Priest-King. During the Mauryan period,
sculpture became refined with the use of polished stone, seen in Ashokan
pillars and lion capitals. The Shunga and Kushana periods contributed
yaksha-yakshi figures and Buddha images. The Gandhara school developed
under Greco-Roman influence and portrayed Buddha in human form with
realistic features. The Mathura school used red sandstone and emphasized
Indian elements and spiritual expression. The Gupta period is considered
the golden age of Indian sculpture. Gupta sculptures are known for ideal
beauty, smooth finish, and spiritual calmness. Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu
themes flourished during this period. Temple sculptures became prominent
in medieval India. Hindu temples depicted gods, goddesses, dancers, and
mythological scenes. South Indian bronze sculptures, especially of
Nataraja, reached excellence during the Chola period. Islamic rule
discouraged idol-making but encouraged decorative stone carving. Modern
Indian sculpture developed during British rule and after independence.
Artists experimented with new materials and styles. Sculptures today
reflect both tradition and modern ideas. Overall, Indian sculpture shows
artistic continuity and cultural diversity.

**Paintings**

Indian painting has a long and rich tradition dating back to prehistoric
times. The earliest examples are found in the Bhimbetka rock shelters,
depicting hunting, dancing, and daily life. During the ancient period,
mural paintings developed, especially in Buddhist contexts. The Ajanta
caves are the finest examples of ancient Indian mural painting. Ajanta
paintings depict Jataka tales, Buddha's life, and court scenes with
natural colors and expressive forms. In the early medieval period,
painting continued in cave temples like Bagh and Badami. Miniature
painting developed during the medieval period. It flourished under royal
patronage. Mughal painting emerged under Akbar and was influenced by
Persian art. Mughal paintings focused on realism, court scenes,
portraits, and historical events. After the decline of the Mughals,
regional schools developed. These include Rajasthani, Pahari, Deccani,
and Bengal schools. Rajasthani paintings emphasized bold colors and
religious themes. Pahari paintings were known for lyrical beauty and
Krishna themes. Deccani paintings showed Persian influence and rich
colors. Under British rule, Company paintings emerged. Modern Indian
painting began in the 20th century. Artists like Raja Ravi Varma blended
Indian themes with European techniques. The Bengal School revived Indian
traditions. Overall, Indian painting reflects cultural diversity and
artistic continuity.

**Pottery Tradition**

Pottery tradition in India dates back to prehistoric times and reflects
early human life. The earliest pottery was handmade and later became
wheel-made. The Indus Valley Civilization had a highly developed pottery
tradition. Indus pottery was mostly red ware with black painted designs.
Shapes included jars, bowls, dishes, and storage pots. During the
Chalcolithic period, regional pottery styles developed across India.
Black and Red Ware was widely used in many regions. Painted Grey Ware
(PGW) is associated with the later Vedic period. PGW pottery is linked
with early iron-using communities. Northern Black Polished Ware (NBPW)
emerged during the Mahajanapada and Mauryan periods. NBPW indicates
urbanization and trade growth. Pottery was used for domestic, ritual,
and commercial purposes. In early historic times, pottery techniques
improved further. With the arrival of Islamic rule, glazed pottery was
introduced in India. Islamic pottery used blue, green, and turquoise
colors. Mughal pottery showed Persian influence and fine glazing.
Terracotta pottery continued in folk traditions. Rural pottery remained
connected to rituals and festivals. Modern pottery blends traditional
and contemporary styles. Pottery remains an important archaeological
source for Indian history.

**Numismatics**

Numismatics is the study of coins and currency and is an important
source of Indian history. Coins provide information about political
authority, economy, trade, and culture. The earliest Indian coins were
punch-marked coins made of silver and copper. These coins belonged to
the Mahajanapada period. Punch-marked coins had symbols like sun,
animals, and geometric signs. The Mauryan Empire issued standardized
punch-marked coins. Indo-Greek rulers introduced die-struck coins with
portraits of kings. These coins had Greek inscriptions and later
bilingual legends. Kushana coins showed rulers and deities, including
Indian and foreign gods. Gold coins became prominent under the Kushanas.
Gupta coins are known for artistic excellence and purity of gold. Gupta
coins depicted kings performing rituals and symbols of power. Regional
kingdoms issued their own coins in the early medieval period. South

**4.CITIZENSHIP**

**Constitutional Provisions**

**CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS OF CITIZENSHIP**

The Constitution of India deals with citizenship under Articles 5 to 11.
These provisions primarily determine who were considered Indian citizens
at the commencement of the Constitution in 1950. They do not provide a
permanent or exhaustive citizenship law. Article 11 empowers Parliament
to regulate citizenship through legislation. Citizenship provisions
ensure political identity and loyalty to the Indian State. India follows
the principle of single citizenship for national unity. The
constitutional scheme avoids discrimination between citizens of
different states. These provisions ensure clarity during the transition
from colonial rule. Citizenship forms the basis for political rights
like voting and contesting elections.

**CITIZENSHIP ACT, 1955**

The Citizenship Act, 1955 was enacted under Article 11 of the
Constitution. It provides detailed provisions for acquisition and loss
of Indian citizenship. Citizenship can be acquired by birth, descent,
registration, naturalization, or incorporation of territory. The Act
also specifies conditions under which citizenship can be terminated. It
applies uniformly across India. Amendments to the Act reflect changes in
migration patterns and security concerns. The Act gives legal certainty
to citizenship status. It plays a crucial role in population governance.
The Act supports India's single citizenship system.

**THE CITIZENSHIP (AMENDMENT) ACT, 2016**

The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2016 aimed to simplify citizenship
procedures for Overseas Citizens of India. It merged the categories of
PIO and OCI into a single OCI status. The amendment relaxed residency
requirements for registration as an OCI cardholder. It also granted OCI
holders parity with NRIs in certain economic and educational matters.
The Act reflects India's engagement with its global diaspora. It does
not grant political rights to OCI holders. The amendment strengthened
India's soft power diplomacy. It sought administrative efficiency. The
Act is important from a prelims factual perspective.

**METHODOLOGY OF GETTING INDIAN CITIZENSHIP**

Indian citizenship can be acquired through five methods prescribed under
the Citizenship Act, 1955. Citizenship by birth depends on place and
date of birth. Citizenship by descent applies to children born abroad to
Indian parents. Citizenship by registration is available to certain
categories like persons of Indian origin. Citizenship by naturalization
requires residence and good character. Citizenship by incorporation
applies when foreign territory becomes part of India. Each method has
specific legal conditions. The process ensures controlled and lawful
inclusion. These methods maintain national security. They reflect
constitutional sovereignty.

**MODES OF LOSING INDIAN CITIZENSHIP**

Indian citizenship can be lost in three ways under the Citizenship Act,
1955. Renunciation occurs when a citizen voluntarily gives up
citizenship. Termination happens when a citizen acquires foreign
citizenship. Deprivation is imposed by the government for fraud or
disloyalty. Loss of citizenship is governed by due process of law. These
provisions ensure allegiance to the Indian State. Citizenship is not
absolute or unconditional. Safeguards exist against arbitrary
deprivation. The law balances rights and national interest. This is a
factual area for prelims.

**CONCEPT OF DUAL CITIZENSHIP**

India does not recognize the concept of dual citizenship. The
Constitution provides for only single citizenship. This ensures national
unity and equality among citizens. A person acquiring foreign
citizenship automatically loses Indian citizenship. However, OCI status
provides limited rights without political privileges. Dual citizenship
is avoided to prevent divided loyalty. Many federal countries allow dual
citizenship, but India does not. This policy strengthens sovereignty. It
simplifies legal obligations. UPSC often tests this distinction.

**SPECIAL PRIVILEGES ENJOYED BY INDIAN CITIZENS**

Indian citizens enjoy exclusive constitutional privileges. These include
the right to vote and contest elections. Only citizens can hold
constitutional offices such as President or Governor. Certain
Fundamental Rights are available only to citizens. Citizens have the
right to form political associations. Employment in government services
is primarily reserved for citizens. Foreigners do not enjoy these
political rights. Citizenship provides full participation in democracy.
These privileges reinforce sovereignty. They distinguish citizens from
aliens.

**RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF CITIZENS**

Citizens enjoy Fundamental Rights such as equality, freedom, and
constitutional remedies. These rights protect individual liberty and
dignity. Citizens are also expected to perform Fundamental Duties under
Article 51A. Duties promote national unity, discipline, and respect for
constitutional values. Rights and duties are complementary in nature.
Enjoyment of rights requires responsible conduct. Duties are moral
obligations, not legally enforceable. Citizenship involves participation
in democracy. The balance ensures orderly governance. This concept is
important for conceptual clarity.

**Indian Diaspora**

**PRAVASI BHARATIYA DIVAS**

Pravasi Bharatiya Divas is celebrated annually to honor the contribution
of the Indian diaspora. It marks the return of Mahatma Gandhi from South
Africa in 1915. The event strengthens engagement between India and

The Directive Principles of State Policy are contained in Part IV of the
Constitution from Articles 36 to 51. They were inspired by the Irish
Constitution and reflect the ideals of social and economic democracy.
DPSPs aim to guide the State in policy-making and governance. They seek
to establish a welfare state by promoting social justice and economic
equality. Unlike Fundamental Rights, DPSPs are non-justiciable in
nature. However, they are fundamental to the governance of the country.
Courts use DPSPs to interpret laws and constitutional provisions. They
represent the moral and socio-economic goals of the Constitution. DPSPs
complement Fundamental Rights. Together, they balance political and
social democracy.

**SOCIALISTIC PRINCIPLES (DPSP)**

Socialistic principles in DPSP aim to promote economic justice and
reduce inequalities. These principles seek to ensure equitable
distribution of wealth and resources. Articles related to socialistic
principles direct the State to secure adequate means of livelihood for
all citizens. They emphasize equal pay for equal work for men and women.
The State is directed to provide humane conditions of work and maternity
relief. These principles also promote social security and welfare of
workers. They reflect the Constitution's commitment to a mixed economy.
The objective is to prevent concentration of wealth. Social justice is
central to these principles. They guide welfare-oriented policies and
legislation.

**GANDHIAN PRINCIPLES (DPSP)**

Gandhian principles in DPSP reflect Mahatma Gandhi's vision of a
self-reliant and ethical society. These principles emphasize rural
development and decentralized governance. They promote village
panchayats as units of self-government. The State is directed to promote
cottage industries in rural areas. They seek to improve the living

State. They direct the State to secure a uniform civil code for
citizens. Free and compulsory education for children was originally part
of these principles. Separation of the judiciary from the executive is
another key objective. The State is directed to promote international
peace and friendly relations. Protection of monuments and places of
national importance is included. These principles emphasize legal reform
and institutional development. They support democratic governance. UPSC
often tests identification and classification of these principles.

outline the moral and civic responsibilities of Indian citizens. They
include respecting the Constitution, promoting harmony, protecting the
sovereignty and integrity of the nation, safeguarding public property,
and upholding scientific temper and human rights. Duties also emphasize
preserving the environment and valuing heritage and culture. While not
enforceable by law, they guide citizens' behavior and support the
effective implementation of Fundamental Rights. Recent developments,
such as the awareness campaigns by the government, the mandatory singing
of the National Anthem in cinema halls, and debates on uniform civil
code and MGNREGA, have highlighted their relevance. Issues like Triple

**ECONOMY\
**

**1.BASIC CONCEPTS**

**Macroeconomic Concepts**

Macroeconomics studies the functioning of the economy as a whole,
focusing on aggregates like national income, employment, inflation, and
growth. It examines how households, firms, and governments interact at a
large scale to determine overall output and welfare. Aggregate demand
and aggregate supply explain equilibrium levels of income and
employment. Business cycles --- boom, recession, depression, and
recovery --- are analyzed to understand fluctuations. Fiscal policy
(government spending/taxation) and monetary policy (money
supply/interest rates) are key instruments. External sector issues like
balance of payments and exchange rates are also part of macroeconomics.
Classical theory emphasizes supply‑side forces, while Keynesian theory
highlights demand management. Modern models like IS‑LM and AD‑AS
integrate both perspectives. Inflation and unemployment are considered
twin challenges. National income accounting provides a framework to
measure performance. Macroeconomics also addresses poverty, inequality,
and sustainable development. For UPSC, mastering macroeconomic concepts
is essential to analyze India's economic policies and global trends.

**Microeconomic Concepts**

Microeconomics is the branch of economics that studies individual units
such as consumers, firms, and markets. It focuses on how decisions are
made regarding resource allocation, pricing, and production. Key
concepts include demand and supply, elasticity, utility, and cost
structures. The law of demand states that quantity demanded falls as
price rises, while supply behaves oppositely. Elasticity measures
responsiveness to price or income changes. Consumer behavior is analyzed
using utility theory, including marginal utility and indifference
curves. Firms aim to maximize profits by minimizing costs and optimizing
output. Market structures---perfect competition, monopoly, monopolistic
competition, and oligopoly---determine pricing and output strategies.
Factor markets allocate labor, capital, and land. Microeconomics also
examines market failures, externalities, and public goods. It provides
the foundation for understanding price mechanisms and policy
interventions. For UPSC, microeconomic concepts are essential for
analytical clarity and policy reasoning

**2.ECONOMIC MEASUREMENTS\
**

**National Income Concepts and Methods of Calculation**

National income measures the total value of goods and services produced
in a country. GDP is the most common indicator, while GNP includes
income earned abroad by nationals. NNP adjusts for depreciation of
capital, and per capita income shows average living standards. Three
methods calculate national income: production, income, and expenditure.
The production method sums value added at each stage, the income method
adds wages, rent, interest, and profits, and the expenditure method
totals consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports.
Double counting is avoided by focusing on value added. Informal sector
activities often make measurement difficult. Price level changes require
real vs nominal GDP distinction. National income helps compare growth
across countries and time. It guides policy decisions on taxation,
subsidies, and welfare. UPSC often asks conceptual and applied questions
on national income accounting.**[\
]{.underline}**

**Economic Growth and Development**

Growth refers to quantitative increase in output, measured by GDP, while
development is broader, including social progress, equity, and
sustainability. Growth can occur without development, e.g., rising GDP
but persistent poverty. Development indicators include HDI, literacy,
life expectancy, and Gini coefficient. Theories of growth include
Harrod‑Domar, Solow, and Rostow's stages. Development theories emphasize
structural change and human capital. Inclusive growth ensures benefits
reach marginalized groups. Sustainable development balances economic,
social, and environmental goals. India's Five Year Plans focused on both
growth and development. Recent policies emphasize innovation,
infrastructure, and skill development. Growth is necessary for
employment generation and poverty reduction, while development requires
redistribution and welfare schemes. Global institutions like UNDP track
development through HDI. UPSC questions often test the difference
between growth and development.

**Inflation**

Inflation is the sustained rise in general price levels. Demand‑pull
inflation arises from excess demand, while cost‑push inflation results
from rising input costs. Stagflation combines inflation with stagnant
growth, and hyperinflation is extreme. India measures inflation via CPI
and WPI, while GDP deflator is another measure. Inflation erodes
purchasing power and redistributes income between borrowers and lenders.
Moderate inflation can encourage investment, but high inflation is
harmful. Monetary policy controls inflation through interest rates and
money supply. Fiscal policy reduces inflation via taxation and reduced
spending. Supply‑side measures improve productivity to curb inflation.
Recent inflation trends in India are linked to food and fuel prices.
UPSC often asks about causes, impacts, and control measures of
inflation.**\
**

**3.MONEY AND BANKING\
**

**Money Function and Classification**

Money is the lifeblood of any economy, serving as a universally accepted
medium of exchange. Its primary functions include acting as a measure of
value, a store of wealth, and a standard of deferred payment. Economists
classify money into commodity money, fiat money, fiduciary money, and
electronic money. Narrow money (M1) includes currency and demand
deposits, while broad money (M3) adds time deposits and other financial
assets. The evolution of money reflects technological progress, from
coins and paper notes to plastic cards and mobile wallets. Money also
plays a critical role in monetary policy, as its supply influences
inflation, interest rates, and investment. In India, the RBI regulates
money supply through repo rate, CRR, and other instruments.
Classification of money helps policymakers track liquidity and design
interventions for stability**.**

**Financial Market and Its Instruments**

The financial market mobilizes funds from savers to investors, ensuring
efficient allocation of resources. It is divided into the money market
(short‑term funds) and capital market (long‑term investments).
Instruments of the money market include treasury bills, commercial
papers, and certificates of deposit, while the capital market features
shares, debentures, and bonds. Derivatives like futures and options
allow risk management. The financial market also includes foreign
exchange and commodity markets. SEBI regulates capital markets to
protect investors. Financial markets provide liquidity, mobilize
savings, and facilitate investment. They influence monetary policy
transmission, as interest rates and credit availability depend on market
conditions. Globalization has integrated India's financial markets with
international flows. UPSC aspirants must understand both structure and
instruments to analyze current developments.

**Banking Structure in India**

India's banking system is multi‑layered, ensuring financial inclusion
and stability. At the apex is the RBI, which regulates monetary policy
and supervises banks. Commercial banks include public sector, private,
and foreign banks. Cooperative banks serve rural and semi‑urban areas,
supporting agriculture and small industries. Regional Rural Banks bridge
the gap between commercial and cooperative banking. Development banks
like NABARD and SIDBI provide long‑term financing. NBFCs complement
banks by offering loans and investment services. Reforms include
liberalization, financial inclusion drives, and digital banking. Schemes
like Jan Dhan Yojana expanded access to banking services. Challenges
include rising NPAs, recapitalization needs, and fintech innovations.
Understanding India's banking structure is vital for analyzing financial
stability and inclusive growth.

**4.PUBLIC FINANCE IN INDIA\
**

**Budgeting**

The budget is the government's annual financial statement, outlining
revenue and expenditure. It reflects fiscal priorities, resource
mobilization, and welfare commitments. Budgeting involves revenue budget
and capital budget. Deficit indicators like fiscal deficit, revenue
deficit, and primary deficit signal economic health. The Union Budget is
presented annually by the Finance Minister, while states prepare their
own budgets. Budgeting is not just accounting but a policy tool for
growth and redistribution. It includes subsidies, welfare spending, and
capital expenditure on infrastructure. Recent reforms like GST have
reshaped fiscal relations. UPSC tests knowledge of budgetary processes,
fiscal indicators, and policy priorities.

**Centre--State Distribution**

Centre--State distribution refers to sharing of financial resources
between Union and States. The Constitution provides division of powers,
but financial resources are concentrated at the Centre. The Finance
Commission recommends devolution of taxes and grants‑in‑aid. Vertical
distribution covers share of states in central taxes, while horizontal
distribution allocates funds among states based on population, income,
and fiscal needs. GST Council acts as a cooperative federal body. States
also receive plan and non‑plan grants. Challenges include fiscal
imbalances and disputes over allocation. Centre--State distribution is
crucial for balanced regional development. For UPSC, understanding this
mechanism is vital to analyze fiscal federalism.

**Fiscal Policy**

Fiscal policy uses taxation and expenditure to influence the economy.
Objectives include growth, employment, inflation control, and equity. In
India, fiscal policy is framed by the Ministry of Finance. Instruments
include direct taxes, indirect taxes, subsidies, and public expenditure.
Fiscal deficit, revenue deficit, and primary deficit are key indicators.
The FRBM Act sets targets for deficit reduction. Fiscal policy balances
short‑term stabilization with long‑term development. Challenges include
balancing growth with fiscal discipline. For UPSC, fiscal policy is
central to understanding governance**.**

**Tax Structure in India (Meaning, Objectives and History)**

India's tax structure is divided into direct and indirect taxes. Direct
taxes include income tax and corporate tax, while indirect taxes include
GST, customs, and excise. Direct taxes are progressive, while indirect
taxes are regressive but easier to collect. Objectives include resource
mobilization, redistribution, and economic stability. Historically,
India's tax system evolved from colonial structures to modern reforms.
GST unified indirect taxation, creating a common national market. Tax
reforms focus on simplification, broadening the base, and improving
compliance. For UPSC, tax structure is crucial to analyze fiscal
policy**.\
**

**5.PLANNING\
Planning Institutions**

Planning in India began with the Planning Commission in 1950, inspired
by socialist ideals. It guided Five Year Plans, focusing on agriculture,
industry, and welfare. In 2015, Planning Commission was replaced by NITI
Aayog, reflecting cooperative federalism. NITI Aayog emphasizes
innovation, technology, and state participation. Planning institutions
shaped India's trajectory, from Green Revolution to IT revolution.
Criticisms include inefficiency and lack of adaptability. Yet, they
remain milestones in India's economic history**.**

**Five Year Plans in India**

Five Year Plans were India's main instruments of economic planning. The
First Plan emphasized agriculture, while the Second Plan focused on
industrialization. Subsequent plans balanced growth with equity and
modernization. The Eighth Plan marked a shift towards liberalization.
Plans addressed employment, poverty, and regional imbalances. They
shaped India's development trajectory. Though discontinued, they remain

**Meaning Objectives and History**

The tax structure in India refers to the system through which the
government collects revenue from individuals and businesses to finance
public expenditure. Taxes are broadly divided into direct taxes, such as
income tax and corporate tax, and indirect taxes, such as GST, customs
duties, and excise. Direct taxes are progressive, aiming at
redistribution of wealth, while indirect taxes are regressive but easier
to administer. The objectives of taxation include mobilizing resources
for development, reducing inequalities, stabilizing the economy, and
influencing consumption and investment patterns. Historically, India's
tax system evolved from colonial practices, where land revenue and
excise were dominant, to modern reforms after independence. The
introduction of income tax and corporate tax provided a stable revenue
base. Over time, committees like the Wanchoo Committee and Kelkar
Committee recommended simplification and rationalization. The landmark
reform was the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2017,
which unified indirect taxes into a single national market. Tax policy
has also focused on widening the base, improving compliance, and
leveraging technology for transparency. Challenges remain in balancing
revenue needs with equity, reducing evasion, and adapting to
globalization. For UPSC, understanding the meaning, objectives, and
history of India's tax structure is crucial to analyzing fiscal policy
and governance.

**6.OPEN ECONOMY**

**Foreign Trade Concepts**

Foreign trade refers to the exchange of goods and services across
national borders, vital for growth and globalization. It includes
exports, imports, balance of trade, and balance of payments. Trade
allows countries to specialize based on comparative advantage,
increasing efficiency. India's foreign trade has evolved from
restrictive policies to liberalization after 1991. Exports include IT
services, textiles, pharmaceuticals, and agricultural products, while
imports are dominated by crude oil, gold, and electronics. Trade balance
often shows deficits due to high import dependence. Concepts like
current account, capital account, and forex reserves are crucial for
external stability. Tariffs, quotas, and subsidies are instruments of
trade policy. Exchange rate movements directly affect competitiveness of
exports and imports. Globalization has integrated India into global
value chains. Challenges include protectionism, global recessions, and
supply chain disruptions. For UPSC, foreign trade concepts are essential
to understand India's external sector.

**Trade Policy and Agreements**

Trade policy governs tariffs, quotas, subsidies, and agreements
regulating international commerce. India's trade policy shifted from
protectionism to liberalization post‑1991 reforms. Export promotion
councils, SEZs, and incentives encourage competitiveness. Trade
agreements include Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), Preferential Trade
Agreements (PTAs), and multilateral commitments under WTO. India
participates in regional groupings like SAARC and ASEAN. Bilateral
agreements with countries like Japan and South Korea enhance market
access. Trade agreements aim to reduce tariffs, promote cooperation, and
attract investment. They also influence competitiveness, technology
transfer, and foreign capital inflows. Challenges include trade
deficits, dumping, and disputes. Recent policies emphasize
diversification of exports and self‑reliance. UPSC often asks about
India's trade agreements and their impact on the economy.

**Exchange Rate**

Exchange rate is the value of one currency in terms of another,
influencing trade, investment, and capital flows. India follows a
managed float system, where RBI intervenes to stabilize volatility.
Depreciation makes exports cheaper but raises import costs, while
appreciation has the opposite effect. Exchange rate regimes include
fixed, floating, and managed float. Exchange rate movements affect
inflation, competitiveness, and forex reserves. RBI uses tools like
forex intervention and monetary policy to manage stability. Exchange
rate policy is crucial for external sector management. Global factors
like oil prices, capital flows, and geopolitical tensions influence
exchange rates. For UPSC, understanding exchange rate regimes and their
impact on India's economy is essential.

**Trade Agreements**

Trade agreements are formal arrangements between countries to regulate
commerce. Bilateral agreements involve two countries, while multilateral
agreements involve many, such as WTO rules. India has signed FTAs with
ASEAN, Japan, and South Korea, among others. Trade agreements aim to
reduce tariffs, enhance market access, and promote cooperation. They
also influence competitiveness, technology transfer, and foreign
investment. Regional agreements strengthen India's integration into
global markets. Challenges include balancing domestic interests with
global commitments. Trade agreements are vital for India's export
promotion and economic diplomacy. UPSC often tests knowledge of India's
trade agreements and their implications.

**International Organizations**

global uncertainties. Exchange rate volatility and capital outflows also
pose risks. Policies like Make in India and PLI schemes aim to boost
exports and reduce import dependence. India's integration into global
value chains enhances competitiveness. Recent developments include
negotiations for new trade agreements and participation in global forums
like G20. For UPSC, analyzing external sector trends is vital for
understanding India's global position.

**7.ECONOMIC SECTORS**

**Poverty**

Poverty in India is measured by income, consumption, and
multidimensional indicators like health, education, and living
standards. Committees such as Tendulkar and Rangarajan have defined
poverty lines. Despite progress, poverty remains uneven across regions
and social groups. Rural poverty is linked to low agricultural
productivity, while urban poverty arises from informal employment.
Poverty reduction strategies include inclusive growth, redistribution,
and targeted welfare schemes. Programs like MGNREGA, PM‑KISAN, and food
security initiatives aim to provide support. Multidimensional Poverty
Index highlights deprivations beyond income. Global institutions like
UNDP track poverty reduction through SDGs. Challenges include
inequality, jobless growth, and climate change. Poverty alleviation
requires sustained investment in education, health, and infrastructure.
For UPSC, poverty is a recurring theme in GS papers and essays.

**BIOLOGY**

**Origin of Life and Cells**

The origin of life on Earth is explained through scientific theories
based on biological and chemical evolution. The chemical evolution
theory, proposed by Oparin and Haldane, states that life originated from
non-living organic molecules formed in the primitive Earth atmosphere.
These molecules gradually combined to form complex compounds like
proteins and nucleic acids. The Miller--Urey experiment (1953) supported
this theory by demonstrating the formation of amino acids under
simulated early Earth conditions.

Cells are the basic structural and functional units of life. The
earliest life forms were unicellular and prokaryotic, lacking a true
nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Over time, more complex
eukaryotic cells evolved. The endosymbiotic theory, proposed by Lynn
Margulis, explains the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts as once
free-living prokaryotes that entered into a symbiotic relationship with
host cells. Understanding the origin of life and cells helps explain
biological evolution and is important for UPSC Prelims from a basic
science perspective.

**Genetics**

Genetics is the branch of biology that deals with heredity and variation
in living organisms. Gregor Mendel is known as the father of genetics
for his experiments on pea plants. He proposed the laws of
inheritance---law of dominance, law of segregation, and law of
independent assortment. Genes are the functional units of heredity and
are located on chromosomes. DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) is the genetic
material in most organisms, while RNA acts as a messenger in protein
synthesis. The double helix structure of DNA was proposed by Watson and
Crick. Genetic information is transferred from parents to offspring
through reproduction. Mutations cause variations and play a role in
evolution. In humans, genetic disorders may be autosomal or sex-linked.
Modern genetics includes applications such as genetic engineering, DNA
fingerprinting, cloning, and gene therapy. Genetics is important for
understanding heredity, evolution, medicine, and biotechnology and is
relevant for UPSC Prelims basic science questions.

**Classification of Living Things**

Classification of living things is the systematic arrangement of
organisms into groups based on similarities and differences. It helps in
identifying, naming, and studying organisms in an organized manner.
Carolus Linnaeus proposed the system of binomial nomenclature, giving
each organism a scientific name. Early classification was based on
physical characteristics, but modern classification uses structural,
genetic, and evolutionary relationships. Living organisms are broadly
divided into five kingdoms by R.H. Whittaker---Monera, Protista, Fungi,
Plantae, and Animalia. Monera includes prokaryotic organisms like
bacteria. Protista consists of unicellular eukaryotes such as algae and
protozoa. Fungi are heterotrophic organisms with cell walls made of
chitin. Plantae are autotrophic and perform photosynthesis. Animalia
includes multicellular heterotrophic organisms without cell walls.
Viruses are excluded from this system as they show both living and
non-living characteristics. Classification is important for
understanding evolution, biodiversity, and relationships among organisms
and is relevant for UPSC Prelims.

**Evolution of Life**

Evolution of life refers to the gradual change in living organisms over
long periods of time, leading to the diversity of life forms on Earth.
The concept of evolution was explained scientifically by Charles Darwin
through his theory of natural selection, which states that organisms
with favourable variations survive and reproduce. Earlier ideas included
Lamarck's theory of inheritance of acquired characters, though it is not
accepted today. Evolution occurs through mechanisms such as mutation,
variation, natural selection, genetic drift, and adaptation. Fossils
provide important evidence of evolution and help trace evolutionary
history. Life evolved from simple unicellular organisms to complex
multicellular forms. Human evolution shows stages from Australopithecus
to Homo sapiens. Evolution explains biodiversity, adaptation, and
continuity of life. This topic is important for UPSC Prelims due to
factual questions on theories, scientists, and evolutionary mechanisms.

**Tissues**

Tissues are groups of similar cells that work together to perform a
specific function. In plants, tissues are mainly classified into
meristematic and permanent tissues. Meristematic tissues are responsible
for growth and are found in roots, stems, and cambium. Permanent tissues
include simple tissues (parenchyma, collenchyma, sclerenchyma) and
complex tissues (xylem and phloem) which help in support and transport.

In animals, tissues are classified into epithelial, connective,
muscular, and nervous tissues. Epithelial tissue covers body surfaces
and organs. Connective tissue supports and binds organs and includes
bone, blood, and cartilage. Muscular tissue helps in movement and is of
three types---skeletal, smooth, and cardiac. Nervous tissue is
responsible for transmitting impulses. Understanding tissue types and
functions is important for UPSC Prelims basic biology questions.

**Endocrine system**

The endocrine system consists of ductless glands that secrete hormones
directly into the bloodstream to regulate body functions. Major
endocrine glands include the hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid,
parathyroid, adrenal, pancreas, pineal, thymus, and gonads. The
pituitary gland is known as the "master gland" as it controls other
endocrine glands. The thyroid gland secretes thyroxine, which regulates
metabolism and growth. Parathyroid hormone controls calcium and
phosphorus balance. The adrenal glands secrete adrenaline and cortisol,
helping the body respond to stress. The pancreas acts as both endocrine
and exocrine gland and regulates blood sugar through insulin and
glucagon. Hormonal imbalance can cause disorders such as diabetes and
thyroid diseases. Knowledge of glands, hormones, and functions.

**Respiratory System**

The respiratory system is responsible for breathing and exchange of
gases in living organisms. In humans, it includes the nose, nasal
cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and lungs. The
lungs contain millions of alveoli, which are thin-walled air sacs where
oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs by diffusion. Oxygen is
transported by hemoglobin in red blood cells, while carbon dioxide is
removed from the body. Breathing involves inhalation and exhalation,
controlled by the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. Cellular
respiration occurs in mitochondria, where oxygen is used to release
energy from food. Efficient functioning of the respiratory system is
essential for energy production and survival.

**The Transport System in Organisms**

The transport system in organisms is responsible for the movement of
nutrients, gases, hormones, and waste materials. In plants, transport
occurs through xylem and phloem. Xylem transports water and minerals
from roots to other parts, while phloem transports food prepared during
photosynthesis. The movement of water in plants is aided by
transpiration pull, root pressure, and capillary action.

In animals, especially humans, the transport system is the circulatory
system, which includes the heart, blood, and blood vessels. The heart
pumps blood through arteries, veins, and capillaries. Blood transports
oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and removes waste products. The human heart
has four chambers and shows double circulation. An efficient transport
system is essential for maintaining internal balance and survival.

**Skeletal and Muscular Systems**

The skeletal system provides shape, support, and protection to the body
and helps in movement. In humans, the skeleton consists of 206 bones,
classified into axial and appendicular skeletons. Bones protect vital
organs such as the brain, heart, and lungs, and also help in blood cell
formation in bone marrow.

The muscular system works with the skeletal system to produce movement.
Muscles are of three types---skeletal (voluntary), smooth (involuntary),
and cardiac muscles. Skeletal muscles are attached to bones and help in
body movements. Smooth muscles are found in internal organs, while
cardiac muscles are present in the heart. Coordination between bones and
muscles enables posture, locomotion, and daily activities.

**Reproductive System**

The reproductive system ensures the continuity of life by producing new
individuals. In humans, reproduction is sexual and involves the fusion
of male and female gametes. The male reproductive system includes
testes, epididymis, vas deferens, accessory glands, and penis. Testes
produce sperms and secrete the hormone testosterone, which regulates
male secondary sexual characters. The female reproductive system
consists of ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and vagina.
Ovaries produce ova and hormones such as estrogen and progesterone.
Fertilization usually takes place in the ampulla of the fallopian tube.
After fertilization, the zygote undergoes cell division and forms an
embryo. The embryo gets implanted in the uterine wall, where further
development occurs. The placenta helps in exchange of nutrients, oxygen,
and waste between mother and fetus. The menstrual cycle is a periodic
process that prepares the uterus for pregnancy. Hormones like FSH, LH,
prolactin, and oxytocin regulate reproductive functions. Reproductive
health, contraception, and population control are important social
aspects.

**Excretory System**

The excretory system is responsible for removing metabolic waste
products from the body. In humans, it consists of kidneys, ureters,
urinary bladder, and urethra. The kidneys are the main excretory organs
and are located on either side of the backbone. Each kidney contains
millions of nephrons, which are the structural and functional units.
Blood is filtered in the glomerulus during urine formation. Useful
substances like water, glucose, and salts are reabsorbed in kidney
tubules. Waste materials such as urea, uric acid, and creatinine are
excreted as urine. Urine passes from kidneys to the urinary bladder
through ureters. The urinary bladder stores urine temporarily. Urine is
expelled from the body through the urethra. The excretory system helps
regulate water balance in the body. It also maintains electrolyte
balance and blood pH. Hormones like ADH and aldosterone regulate kidney
function. Lungs and skin also assist in excretion. Proper functioning of
the excretory system is essential for homeostasis.

**Nutrition**

Nutrition is the process by which organisms obtain and utilize food for
energy, growth, repair, and maintenance of the body. Nutrients include
carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, water, and roughage.
Carbohydrates are the main source of energy, while proteins are required
for growth and tissue repair. Fats provide stored energy and help in
insulation. Vitamins and minerals are needed in small quantities for
proper functioning of the body. Nutrition in organisms is classified
into autotrophic and heterotrophic types. Green plants show autotrophic
nutrition by photosynthesis. Animals follow heterotrophic nutrition and
depend on plants or other animals for food. Human nutrition involves
ingestion, digestion, absorption, assimilation, and egestion. Digestion
breaks complex food into simpler substances. Absorbed nutrients are used
for energy and body functions. Deficiency of nutrients leads to diseases
like anemia and scurvy. Balanced diet provides all nutrients in proper
amounts. Nutrition is essential for immunity and overall health.

**Diseases**

Diseases are conditions that disturb the normal functioning of the body.
They can be broadly classified into communicable and non-communicable
diseases. Communicable diseases are caused by pathogens like bacteria,
viruses, fungi, and protozoa. These diseases spread through air, water,
food, direct contact, or vectors. Examples include tuberculosis,
malaria, cholera, and dengue. Non-communicable diseases are not
infectious and are often related to lifestyle or genetics. Diabetes,
cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension are major
non-communicable diseases. Nutritional deficiency diseases occur due to
lack of essential nutrients. Examples include scurvy, rickets, and
anemia. Immunity helps the body resist infections. Vaccination provides
artificial immunity against diseases. Poor hygiene and sanitation
increase disease spread. Healthy lifestyle and balanced diet help
prevent diseases. Public health measures play a key role in disease
control.

**Economic Zoology**

Economic zoology is the study of animals that are useful or harmful to
humans. It focuses on the practical applications of animals in
agriculture, medicine, industry, and research. Apiculture involves the
rearing of honeybees for honey, wax, and royal jelly. Sericulture is the
cultivation of silkworms for silk production. Fisheries and aquaculture
provide protein-rich food and employment. Livestock like cows, goats,
and buffaloes supply milk, meat, leather, and wool. Some insects and
animals act as pollinators, helping in crop production. Certain animals
are used in scientific research, such as Drosophila in genetics. Animals
like earthworms improve soil fertility. Some animals are pests, causing
crop damage or spreading diseases, e.g., mosquitoes and locusts. In
medicine, animals contribute to vaccine production and drugs.
Conservation of useful species ensures sustainable benefits. Economic
zoology links biodiversity with human welfare.
